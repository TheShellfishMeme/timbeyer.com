This is my personal website.  
It was made with Backbone, Handlebars and Bootstrap.  
All data comes from (static) JSON files.

Problem to solve: how to expose that data to search engines.  
Possible approach: use Node.js to do the rendering relying on the
[_escaped_fragment_ approach](https://developers.google.com/webmasters/ajax-crawling/docs/getting-started).
